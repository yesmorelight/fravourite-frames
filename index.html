        <h2>STAR WARS - EPISODE VII: THE FORCE AWAKENS</h2>
        <p>Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Jennifer. George: you ever think of running for class president? Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.          <br />

Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Doc? About 30 years, it's a nice round number. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Just finishing up the second coat now.</p>

          <p>That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. You know what I do in those situations? Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? I gotta go, uh, I gotta go.</p>

I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time.</p>
